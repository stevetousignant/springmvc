This application is only dedicated to help me to settle a complete dev environnement:

   - Git (source versionning)
   - Sonar (Quality code review)
   - Jenkins 2 (Build, Continue integration, Job pipe line)
   - Apache 2 (SSL connexion, Load balancing, Security, multiple hosting with virtual host, mod_Proxy)
   - test ST
